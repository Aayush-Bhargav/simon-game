Building the simple Simon Game using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT only.

The Simon Game is a memory and matching game that consists of a series of colored lights and sounds. Players must remember and repeat a sequence of lights and sounds. The sequence starts with one light and sound, and each round adds another light and sound to the sequence. The game tests memory and concentration.
